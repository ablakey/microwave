# The Microwave.

A microwave implemented in TypeScript and CSS.

This project is for *fun*.

## Stuff I Learned

- Container Queries! FINALLY a comfortable way to resize fonts based on the local parent.
- How much I hate State Machines in TypeScript and will opt for flat conditional logic when the machine is simple enough.
- Getting CSS glow effects just right.
- 7 Digit Display fonts are so helpful!
